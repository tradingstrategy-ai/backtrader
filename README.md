# Trading Strategy Backtrader

This is patched and bug fixed version for [Backtrader library](https://pypi.org/project/backtrader/). This package is a dependency for [trading-strategy](https://github.com/tradingstrategy-ai/client) package.

The `backtrader` project was forked and the fork released on a different PyPi package name `trading-strategy-backtrader` because the original was unmaintained and unusable as a PyPi package dependency.
